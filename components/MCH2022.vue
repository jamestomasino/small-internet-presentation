  <div class="center padding">
    <p>
      The <span class="yellow">web is a mess</span>, bloated with
      data-gathering trackers, predatory UX, massive resource loads, and it
      is absorbing everything it touches. The
      <span class="pink">Small Internet</span>
      is a counter-cultural movement to wrangle things back
      under control via minimalism, hands-on participation, and good old
      fashioned conversation. At its heart are technologies like the venerable
      <span class="green">Gopher protocol</span> or the new <span class="green">Gemini protocol</span>
      offering a refuge and a place to dream of a better future.
